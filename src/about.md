# Till Wegmüller—@toasterson
## Systems Engineer • OpenIndiana Developer • Infrastructure Architect

---

**[SYSTEM LOGIN]** *Grüessech*, and welcome to my profile...

I'm Till, though most people call me Toasty. I work as an independent systems engineer based in Europe, specializing in OpenIndiana distribution development, Rust programming, and Unix infrastructure.

## **[CORE COMPETENCIES]**

My expertise centers around OpenIndiana distribution development, where I contribute to package maintenance, system integration, and helping users adopt modern Unix environments. I develop primarily in Rust for system-level applications and manage virtualized infrastructure at scale.

- OpenIndiana distribution development
- Rust systems programming
- Container orchestration
- Virtualization infrastructure
- Open source contributions
```

## **[TECHNICAL STACK]**

**Primary Operating Environment:** OpenIndiana
**Secondary Systems:** Various Unix distributions as needed
**Programming Languages:** Rust, Shell scripting
**Virtualization:** bhyve, zones/containers, QEMU/KVM
**Orchestration:** Kubernetes, Docker, containerd
**Specializations:** Package management, system administration, infrastructure automation

### **[CURRENT PROJECTS]**

### ⚙️ **OpenIndiana Distribution Development**
**Project Type:** Core Distribution Work
**Mission:** Contributing to the OpenIndiana operating system through package maintenance, system integration work, and user support. This involves ensuring software compatibility, managing dependencies, and helping the community adopt modern development practices.

## **[CLOSING NOTES]**

I focus on building reliable infrastructure using proven Unix principles enhanced with modern tools. Whether developing efficient Rust applications, maintaining OpenIndiana packages, or orchestrating container workloads, the goal is always creating systems that work reliably and can be maintained by the next engineer.

My approach combines traditional Unix wisdom with contemporary development practices to create infrastructure that's both robust and accessible.
