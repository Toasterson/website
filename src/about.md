# Till Wegmüller—@toasterson
## Systems Architect • Illumos Navigator • Space Opera Philosopher

---

**[SYSTEM LOGIN]** *Grüessech*, fellow traveler of the digital expanse...

You have accessed the classified personnel file of **Till "Toasty" Wegmüller**, an independent systems architect operating across the European and Brazilian sectors of the global computational grid. Much like the Mentats of Frank Herbert's universe, I serve as a human computer, processing the complex interactions between hardware, software, and the infinite possibilities that emerge when silicon meets consciousness.

## **[CORE DIRECTIVES]**

My primary mission parameters include deep-system programming, where I navigate the labyrinthine depths of **illumos** kernel space with the same precision that a Guild Navigator folds space-time. I am fluent in the ancient tongues of **C** and **Assembly**, while wielding the memory-safe power of **Rust** and the elegant simplicity of **Go** to build tomorrow's infrastructure today.

- Rust Systems Integration
- Live Code Transmissions via Twitch.tv/Toasterson
```

## **[TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS]**

**Primary Operating Environment:** illumos/OpenIndiana  
**Secondary Systems:** Various Linux distributions, when the mission requires  
**Programming Languages:** Rust, Go, C, Assembly, and whatever the system demands  
**Specializations:** Kubernetes orchestration, Unix systems programming, distributed systems architecture  
**Combat Experience:** Extensive battles with compiler errors, kernel panics, and the occasional existential crisis

### **[PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK]**

> *"I must not fear bugs. Bugs are the mind-killer. Bugs are the little-death that brings total code obliteration. I will face my bugs. I will permit them to pass over me and through me. And when they have gone past I will turn the inner eye to see their path. Where the bugs have gone there will be nothing. Only clean code will remain."*

## **[ACTIVE OPERATIONS]**

### 🚀 **Aurora OpenCloud**
**Mission Classification:** Open Source Supremacy  
**Objective:** Building a federated cloud orchestrator for illumos that will make the Spacing Guild's monopoly on space travel look quaint. This is infrastructure for the post-scarcity future.

**→** [Access Mission Files](https://github.com/OpenFlowLabs/aurora-opencloud)

### ⚙️ **Illumos Core Development**
**Mission Classification:** Kernel-Level Operations  
**Objective:** Contributing to the beating heart of the most elegant Unix descendant ever conceived. Where every system call is a prayer to the machine gods, and every commit ripples through computational space-time.

**→** [Enter the Source](https://www.illumos.org/)

### 🦀 **Rust Systems Integration**
**Mission Classification:** Memory Safety Evangelism  
**Objective:** Bringing the memory-safe future to systems programming, one careful refactor at a time. Teaching ancient C codebases to embrace the Rust revolution without losing their Unix soul.

**→** [Read Mission Logs](/blog/)

### 📦 **Package Management Renaissance**
**Mission Classification:** Developer Experience Enhancement  
**Objective:** Creating tools like [IPS in Rust](https://github.com/OpenFlowLabs/ips) and the [illumos Installer](https://github.com/Toasterson/illumos-installer) to make package management as elegant as a well-crafted space opera plot.

## **[COLLABORATION PROTOCOLS]**

I am always seeking fellow navigators for collaborative missions. Whether you're interested in:

- **Illumos kernel development** (where mortals fear to tread)
- **Rust systems programming** (memory safety for the win)
- **Cloud orchestration** (because someone needs to organize the digital cosmos)
- **Live coding adventures** (real-time problem solving with audience participation)

The communication channels are open. I maintain active presence across multiple networks:

## **[CLOSING TRANSMISSION]**

In this vast digital universe, where bits and bytes flow like the spice of Arrakis, I continue the eternal quest to build better systems, write cleaner code, and occasionally ponder whether the machines will remember us fondly when they inherit the stars.

The code must flow. The systems must evolve. And somewhere in the space between silicon and soul, we find the true magic of computation.

*May your compilers be swift, your deploys be clean, and may you never encounter a segmentation fault at 3 AM.*
