# Till Wegmüller—@toasterson
## Unix Systems Engineer • Rust Developer • Infrastructure Architect

---

**[SYSTEM LOGIN]** *Grüessech*, and welcome to my profile...

I'm Till, though most people call me Toasty. I work as an independent systems engineer across Europe and Brasil, focusing on the intersection of modern development practices and solid Unix foundations. Think of me as someone who believes that the old ways (pipes, processes, and proper error handling) combined with modern tools (Rust, Kubernetes, containers) create the most reliable systems.

## **[CORE COMPETENCIES]**

My expertise centers around building and maintaining robust infrastructure using time-tested Unix principles enhanced with modern tooling. I work primarily with **illumos** systems, develop in **Rust**, orchestrate with **Kubernetes**, and manage virtualized environments at scale.

- Rust systems programming
- Kubernetes cluster management  
- Unix system administration
- Virtualization infrastructure
- Open source contributions
```

## **[TECHNICAL STACK]**

**Primary Environment:** illumos/OpenIndiana  
**Languages:** Rust, Go, C, Shell scripting  
**Orchestration:** Kubernetes, Docker, containerd  
**Virtualization:** bhyve, QEMU/KVM, zones/containers  
**Networking:** TCP/IP, SDN, service mesh architectures  
**Philosophy:** "This is #Unix, use the Pipe Padawan"

### **[CURRENT PROJECTS]**

I'm always working on something interesting. Here's what's currently consuming my cycles:

### 🚀 **Aurora OpenCloud**
**Project Type:** Open Source Infrastructure  
**Mission:** Building a federated cloud orchestrator specifically designed for illumos environments. This isn't just another Kubernetes distribution—it's about bringing modern orchestration to Unix systems while respecting their architectural principles.

**→** [View on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenFlowLabs/aurora-opencloud)

### ⚙️ **illumos Ecosystem Development**
**Project Type:** Core System Contributions  
**Mission:** Contributing to the illumos operating system, maintaining packages, and helping bridge the gap between traditional Unix and modern development practices. Every commit here matters for the entire ecosystem.

**→** [Learn More](https://www.illumos.org/)

### 🦀 **Rust Systems Programming**
**Project Type:** Language Integration  
**Mission:** Bringing memory safety to systems programming without sacrificing Unix philosophy. Projects include [IPS in Rust](https://github.com/OpenFlowLabs/ips) and various infrastructure tools that need both performance and reliability.

**→** [Read Technical Posts](/blog/)

### 📦 **Infrastructure Tooling**
**Project Type:** Developer Experience  
**Mission:** Creating tools that make Unix systems more accessible to modern development workflows. From package management to deployment automation—making the Force strong with this generation of developers.

## **[COLLABORATION OPPORTUNITIES]**

I'm always interested in working with fellow engineers on:

- **illumos system development** (kernel and userland)
- **Rust infrastructure projects** (especially systems-level work)
- **Kubernetes ecosystem** (operators, CNI plugins, storage)
- **Virtualization technology** (hypervisors, container runtimes)
- **Open source consulting** (architecture, implementation, maintenance)

## **[CLOSING NOTES]**

In a galaxy of complex distributed systems and ever-changing technologies, I remain focused on building reliable infrastructure using proven Unix principles enhanced with modern tools. Whether it's crafting efficient Rust code, orchestrating Kubernetes clusters, or diving deep into illumos internals, the goal is always the same: create systems that work reliably and can be maintained by the next engineer.

The Force is strong with those who understand pipes, embrace proper error handling, and aren't afraid to read the manual.

*May your builds be reproducible, your deployments be automated, and may you never encounter a race condition at 3 AM.*
