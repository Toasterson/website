# New Website with SvelteKit

Hello everyone. So I recently had the desire to make a new Blog post since I now write with helix but hugo did not like me.

So I did what all time conscious people do, I redid my blog from scratch... 

As I want to get finally more into making Webdev stuff i decided to give one of the new server based 
frameworks a try. So I chose [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) to have to possibility to later add nice features and portfolio and other 
parts to the site. I have copied all my blog posts and formatted them in the new svelte markdown extensions [MDsvex](https://mdsvex.com/)
The theme is still experimental so feedback is welcome. But I already like that I can include svelte components and render them like 
this:

*[Note: Interactive component would go here in the original Svelte version]*

So when I make a fancy code highlighter I can include it directly into my blog posts. Also I can see to add a slides page
to my system to display the talks I have given before.

So for now enjoy this little update and more to come soon :)
