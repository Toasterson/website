# New Blog Site

Hello everyone! As I haven't written anything in quite a while,
it became apparent that I either have to switch my site
to something more usefull or to start writing again.

As I am always doing something but never talking about it,
I figured this is as good an opportunity to start writing
as any other. And I actually would like to do that. 

So to grab that opportunity and have some fun, I decided
to restart my blog and make it basically my status update site.
Write what software I am writing, why I am writing it
and what I am thinking about things. 

For one this gives some insight for others that do
packaging and development work. And on the other side
I think and design quite some things that I am passionate about and
would like to share more. But since writing themed articles takes
a lot of time I want this to be more freestyle.

If you like this more freestyle kind of content enjoy the reading :)
And let me know on the Socials what you guys think.
