            You have found my personal blog on the Internet. Here you can find my blog posts some
            information about me and some project showcases I have been working on. Since this Blog is
            written in <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300 underline">SvelteKit</a> I can add as many features
            here as I like and make this space my own. I do my styling with <a
                href="https://tailwindcss.com/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300 underline">TailwindCSS</a> so expect me to get some better styling eventually. Suggestions welcome :)
